What Is AR?

Almost any person with a smartphone can get access to augmented reality, making it more efficient than VR as a branding and gaming tool. AR morphs the mundane, physical world into a colorful, visual one by projecting virtual pictures and characters through a phone's camera or video viewer. Augmented reality is merely adding to the user's real-life experience

What Is VR?

Virtual reality takes these same components to another level by producing an entirely computer-generated simulation of an alternate world. These immersive simulations can create almost any visual or place imaginable for the player using special equipment such as computers, sensors, headsets, and gloves.

What's the Difference Between the Two?

The distinctions between VR and AR come down to the devices they require and the experience itself:

    AR uses a real-world setting while VR is completely virtual
    AR users can control their presence in the real world; VR users are controlled by the system
    VR requires a headset device, but AR can be accessed with a smartphone
    AR enhances both the virtual and real world while VR only enhances a fictional reality
