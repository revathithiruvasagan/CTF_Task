4. Reducing APK Size of an AR App

- Optimize Assets: Compress images and 3D models. Use lower-resolution textures where possible.
- Remove Unused Resources: Audit and delete any unused assets or libraries.
- Code Optimization: Minimize code by using ProGuard or R8 to remove unused code and reduce method count.
- Use Asset Bundles: Load large assets dynamically instead of bundling them all into the APK.
- Split APKs: Create different APKs for different device configurations (e.g., screen density).
